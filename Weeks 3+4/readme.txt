these are important things I could not include in the graph:

Each List is increased by 100000
Each amount of items sorted in each list is increased by 50000

List  1  time is  0.00020272731781005858
List  2  time is  0.04388890266418457
List  3  time is  0.14571599960327147
List  4  time is  0.30848097801208496
List  5  time is  0.5837455749511719
List  6  time is  0.9510664701461792
List  7  time is  1.3497042179107666
List  8  time is  1.8310670852661133
List  9  time is  2.4146103382110597
List  10  time is  3.0831415176391603
The average of all of the list times is  1.0711623811721802


These are the values the graph is based on


I also used an online graph maker so I dont know how readable that is to you, so this is the data in plain text
